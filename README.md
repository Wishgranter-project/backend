# Wishgranter music player ( backend )

In early development.

This is a little project of mine, a web-based music player.

It has been built around my [descriptive playlist](https://github.com/wishgranter-project/descriptive-playlist-definition) concept.

This repository contains the backend, the user interface can be found [here](https://github.com/wishgranter-project/frontend).
